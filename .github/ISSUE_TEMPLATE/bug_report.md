<!--
**IMPORTANT**: If you want to report several bugs or feature requests, please create separate bug reports for every single bug or feature request, don't bundle them into the same bug report.

To make a useful bug report, please fill the information below: -->

**Version of Variety**
<!-- Find it in Variety -> About -->



**Describe the bug**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->



**Context**
<!-- Does it happen *every* time you do something, or just sometimes? Does it happen only when Variety is starting while the computer starts, or this does not matter? Can you link it to some specific action, wallpaper image, event, etc.? When applicable, describe the steps needed to reproduce the bug. -->



**To Reproduce**
<!-- Are there reliable steps to reproduce the behavior? -->
1.
2.
3.

**Attach Variety's log file**
<!-- If possible, please run `variety -v` in a terminal, reproduce the bug, quit Variety and attach this log file to the bug report: `~/.config/variety/variety.log`. You may want to first manually check the log for exceptions, errors or warnings after you see the bug - if you can make an educated guess to what is happening, your bug report will be more helpful.

Do use the `-v` parameter - without it the log is useless. -->



**Desktop environment and version**
<!-- Which desktop environment you are using, and which version of it - e.g. GNOME, XFCE, KDE, Unity, etc.? -->



**OS name and version**
<!-- Please paste the output of `cat /etc/issue && cat /etc/os-release`? -->



**Screenshots**
<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->



**Attached files**
<!-- If it is particular images that trigger the bug, please attach them. -->



**Additional context**
<!-- Add any other context about the problem here.

Thank you. -->
